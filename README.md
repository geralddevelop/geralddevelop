# Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to my colorful corner of the code universe! 🌈✨ I'm Gerald, a passionate developer who loves turning coffee into code and dreams into projects. 🚀

## 🚧 Current Project: Part-time Roster 

🎉 Exciting times! I'm currently working on **Part-time Roster** , where pixels meet passion and bugs are squashed with joy. Join me on this coding rollercoaster!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Now

I build my projects mainly with these frameworks and tech!

- **React JS (Typescript)**: Make my web look pretty
- **Flutter**: Why code 2 times when you can code once and ship for both IOS and Android? 🥰
- **Django**: Go to backend for everything!
- **Express JS**: Sometimes JS is the way to go

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- **Everyday Coder**: Coding is like a hobby instead of a job, catch me coding new projects or researching on new tech every now and then 😜
- **Avid Dancer**: Other than coding I love to dance, catch me during social nights!
